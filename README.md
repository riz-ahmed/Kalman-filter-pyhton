# Kalman-filter-pyhton
A linear Kalman filter algorithm developed using Python3. This filter is used for state estimation required for designing prediction algorithms as well as full state feedback controller algorithms.

# Simulator
A pre-develoepd external simulator is imported to this project that plots the actual and estiamted states of a car as well as shows a basic animation of the vehicle as it travels ar varying speeds and along various paths.
